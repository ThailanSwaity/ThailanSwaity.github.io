            <p>My name is Thailan Swaity. I'm a student in the second year of my 4 year <em>Computer Science</em> 
               degree program at the <em>Univserity of Winnipeg</em>. I'm the type of person that is almost always working
               towards some type of goal, whether it be related to a personal project I'm working on, or some skill that
               I'm trying to learn.</p>
            <p>You can see some of the projects that I've made over on my 
               <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ThailanSwaity" rel="noopener noreferrer">github</a> page. Currently, my 
               interests are Javascript, HTML, and css (Web Development)
               but I have done some programming in Java, making hobby games, as well as Python, which I've 
               used for getting data from APIs and I've used it for some machine learning as well.

          <h3 class="header">What are some of my hobbies?</h3>
          <p>
            Of course a large portion of my hobbying time is spent programming, but I have a lot of other hobbies as well.
            There isn't enough time in the day to do all of the things you would like to do! :)
            A lot of my other hobbies are art related. You may be interested in some of the music I've made, also maybe not. 
            Usually when someone says they like to make music it ends up being terrible. However, whether good or bad, I enjoy
            making it. Anyway, you can check out some of my released music on 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://open.spotify.com/artist/6QbL8HYqIu69NJJTfqISbT" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a>.

            <p>
              Something that is important for an artist is having artwork for their released music. So naturally, I have a lot.
              The banner above is something I have made in the past that I think looks quite interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Take a look at this small gallery of artwork I've made for music in the past.
